# So many dependencies, so little time

One of the interesting side effects of using a completely custom toolchain to build `bpf-iotrace` is
that every single one of the third-party libraries it uses must be built with the same toolchain,
transitive dependencies included.

This drastically increases the complexity of `bpf-iotrace`'s build environment
because every library's source code must be checked out, configured, and built.
Then, those libraries and their headers must be staged where the main project can find them.
This explosion of complexity is especially challenging when a project's direct dependencies have
dependencies of their own (also known as transitive dependencies).
Thankfully, tools like [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/overview)
and [conan](https://conan.io) can generate complete dependency graphs for a project and provide APIs for fetching,
building, and installing third-party libraries in consistent and maintainable ways.
Both projects also have large collections of pre-written build scripts for most popular, open source C and C++
libraries.

This is especially helpful where libraries and frameworks like protobuf and gRPC are concerned because projects that
use them frequently benefit from object libraries _and_ up-to-date code generation utilities
being available at configuration time.

`bpf-iotrace` uses `vcpkg` because `vcpkg` offers simpler integration with CMake and greater flexibility
when integrating caching for source code and pre-built binary artifacts.

# Integrating `vcpkg` with the `bpf-iotrace` build system
[`vcpkg`'s README file](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/README.md) recommends installing `vcpkg` as
a submodule within the project that uses it.
I like this advice because it makes it easier to automate bootstrapping `vcpkg` as part of the project configuration
step.

The installation process is as simple as changing to the project directory where vcpkg should be located and running
`git submodule add https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`

To integrate `vcpkg` with `bpf-iotrace`'s CMake build system,
I added the following lines to the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` before the first
`project()` command:
```
set(VCPKG_FIXUP_ELF_RPATH ON)

set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/tools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
        CACHE STRING "Vcpkg toolchain file")

if(NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE})
    # Initialize / update the vcpkg submodule
    execute_process(COMMAND git submodule update --init --depth 1 -- tools/vcpkg
            WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}
            COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL ANY)
endif()
```

This is where things get tricky because `bpf-iotrace` also relies on `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
to point CMake at the custom toolchain in its development container.
Fortunately, `vcpkg` offers two mechanisms for resolving this conflict.
I can [`include()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/include.html) `vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
in my own toolchain file, or I can set `VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to point at my compiler toolchain file,
and `vcpkg` and CMake will use its contents for setting up the project's compilers.
I opted for the latter approach to be consistent with how vcpkg configures its package builds.

So the preamble of my top-level `CMakeLists.txt` becomes:
```
set(VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/.devcontainer/toolchain.cmake
        CACHE STRING "Dev container toolchain file")
set(VCPKG_FIXUP_ELF_RPATH ON)

set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/tools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
        CACHE STRING "Vcpkg toolchain file")

if(NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE})
    # Initialize / update the vcpkg submodule
    execute_process(COMMAND git submodule update --init --depth 1 -- tools/vcpkg
            WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}
            COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL ANY)
endif()
```

Now, even on a fresh git clone of `bpf-iotrace`, CMake will download `vcpkg` to the correct directory, and bootstrap
it and all the project's other dependencies at configuration time.
It will also use the dev container's custom toolchain to build the main project.

# Overlays in vcpkg

As nifty as `vcpkg` is, some of its default's don't work for `bpf-iotrace`.
Even with `VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` set for the main project, it insists on using the dev container's default
compiler rather than its custom toolchain.
It also tries to statically link every third-party dependency.
This is usually desirable because it would simplify the heck out of the `bpf-iotrace` installation process.
But it is problematic when any project depends on [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)-licensed
libraries like [elfutils libelf](https://sourceware.org/elfutils/).
Compliance with LGPL license terms is way easier when LGPL-licensed libraries are dynamically linked.
_(DISCLAIMER: the preceding sentence is **engineering** advice, **NOT** legal advice. Always make sure you and your
company's lawyer(s) are on the same page before incorporating any LGPL code into your products.)_

Another `bpf-iotrace`-specific limitation for `vcpkg` is that its default registry does not include `bpf-trace`'s
most important third-party dependency: [`libbpf`](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf).

Fortunately, `vcpkg` provides hooks called overlays that allow users to customize its behavior for their needs and
add missing packages without having to create a full-blown registry.

## Building vcpkg dependencies with a custom toolchain
In `vcpkg`, [triplets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/triplets) encapsulate the definition of
a library's build environment, and the library's build configuration.
`vcpkg` ships with default triplets for several popular target platforms including Linux on x86_64 called
[x64-linux.cmake](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/triplets/x64-linux.cmake).

To tailor the `x64-linux` triplet for `bpf-iotrace`'s needs, we can create a directory to contain triplet overlays in
[`tools/vcpkg-overlays/triplets`](https://github.com/mprzybylski/bpf-iotrace/tree/main/tools/vcpkg-overlays/triplets),
and reference that directory in
[`vcpkg-configuration.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/reference/vcpkg-configuration-json).
Then we can create a modified copy of `x64-linux.cmake` in `tools/vcpkg-overlays/triplets` with the following contents:
```
set(VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../../.devcontainer/toolchain.cmake")

# List of LGPL-licensed dependencies AND transitive dependencies that must be dynamically linked to them.
set(LGPL_DEPENDENCIES elfutils bzip2)

set(VCPKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE x64)
set(VCPKG_CRT_LINKAGE dynamic)
set(VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE static)
# Force LGPL dependencies to be dynamically linked
if(PORT IN_LIST LGPL_DEPENDENCIES)
    set(VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE dynamic)
endif()

set(VCPKG_CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
```

Setting `VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` in a triplet file causes vcpkg libraries to build with the toolchain it
specifies instead of using `vcpkg`'s default compiler detection logic.

We also selectively enable dynamic linking `elfutils` (`libelf`) which is LGPL-licensed, and `bzip2` because shared
`libelf` builds fail unless `bzip2` is also built as a shared library.

## New or customized port files
The process of publishing or updating a port published in a `vcpkg` registry is
[complex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/maintainers/registries) enough to make rapid iteration difficult.
`vcpkg`'s [overlay ports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/concepts/overlay-ports) feature makes it possible to
quickly test new ports, or changes to an existing port before publishing them to a registry.
