# Hi.  I'm Mike Przybylski.

I'm an electrical engineer by training, and a software and systems engineer by
trade.  I've worked on an internet service provider and mobile operator in the
South Pacific, climbed around on the side of particle physics detectors the size of a
house, maintained systems that keep mad scientists from irradiating themselves,
built teams to debug bizarre performance, functionality, and connectivity
issues in enterprise software, and built an eBPF-based instrumentation product
from scratch to capture HTTP API traffic.

On this page, you will find articles about projects I've worked on and
interesting problems I've had to solve.

Thanks for stopping by.
